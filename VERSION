v1.0.0
2025-12-22
"e-bazar" - Release 1 (snapshot)

Notes:
- Core routing and model fixes (router support for ?url, Ad model converted)
- Added basic authentication: register/login/logout, hashed passwords, CSRF tokens
- Added Admin seed (scripts/init_db.php creates default admin)
- Added DB schema improvements for ads (owner_id, description, delivery_modes, sold, created_at)
- Added pages: create ad (form), store ad, dashboard (myAds), admin dashboard
- Added safe DB migration in scripts/init_db.php
- Improved frontend paths (absolute asset paths) and small JS API compatibility

How to reproduce:
- Run `php scripts/init_db.php` to create admin and migrate DB
- Start server: `php -S 0.0.0.0:8000 -t .`
- Visit: http://localhost:8000/e-bazar/

If you prefer, install git and I can create a git tag `v1.0.0` for this release.
